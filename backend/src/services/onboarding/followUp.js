// Voice Onboarding — bharani-tasks.md Section 1's FOLLOWUP state.
//
// Section 1.1: FOLLOWUP "loop[s] until required fields are non-null,"
// asking "one question per null required field." This module decides
// WHICH question to ask next — pure logic only, no WhatsApp send call,
// no text-to-speech (Section 1's eventual voice-note delivery is a later,
// separate step; this function only returns text).
//
// Field order and "what counts as required" both come from
// stateMachine.js's REQUIRED_FIELDS_FOR_LIVE — the same list the LIVE
// gate itself checks (destId included, per the earlier branch that made
// destId's schema requirement conditional the same way name/type's is).
// Reusing it here, rather than a second hardcoded field list, means this
// module can never drift out of sync with what LIVE actually requires.
// isRequiredFieldPresent is reused for the same reason: priceRangeINR's
// Mongoose-nested-object-defaults-to-{} quirk (confirmed for real, see
// that function's own comment in stateMachine.js) must be detected
// identically here and at the LIVE gate, not via a second, possibly
// drifting presence check.

// destId's question is deliberately NOT "what is your destId" — an
// operator has no idea what that means, and the field's real semantics
// are "which town/area is this near," not a slug. The spoken answer
// still needs a separate resolution step (transcript text -> the
// canonical DESTINATIONS slug) that is NOT built here — this module only
// asks an honest question about location, it does not resolve the answer.
